                  <p>This website and my position at theScore go hand-in-hand for me; they both gave me new opportunities to grow my knowledge, skills, and within my career. Working as a QA Automation Engineer taught me about new frameworks, new ways to write testing code for web platforms, and how to work in a large and diverse team.</p>
                  <p>Making a website from scratch and learning about web development independently was the best compliment to my co-op experience for this summer. I cannot wait to hone and improve my skills, searching for great opportunities like this one!</p>

                  <p>My goals this summer included learning how to debug more effectively, integrating myself into the automation team, and learning to contribute and merge completed automation tickets into the codebase. These goals were made specifically for this automation position, and in order to grow and improve in the skills necessary for the job. </p>
                  <p>Looking to improve upon my communication skills within a team, as well as acquire new technological skills too, I wanted to learn how to code in new ways and languages this work term. I even got experience using CI and test plan tools too, such as Jenkins and TestRail. In future job opportunities, not only will I have an understanding of how to deliver suitable code in a team dynamic, common applications like Jira and GitHub will no longer be new for me.</p>
                  <p>The most prevalent skills I learned were how to code within a team setting; whether in pair programming sessions or code-reviews, strong communication skills and a willingness to learn were both very important to finding success. Applying these skills everyday allowed me to complete pull requests and make contributions to the coverage the automation team provided. I was even able to identify notable bugs and eliminate the resulting errors. Gaining experience with debugging and writing automation code in a team setting was exactly what I was looking for this term in order to complete my goals.</p>

                  <p>As a QA Automation Engineer, it was my job to maintain automation Web frameworks for Vegas, the back-end admin platform component of theScore Bet (the TSB app). As bi-weekly releases were developed, the QA team for Vegas would verify features function as intended and the automation team would dedicate 2-3 employees to automate 30%+ of the test coverage.</p>
                  <p>Using cucumber/Gherkin feature files, and Kotlin code for the implemented steps, Selenium drivers would be able to navigate and complete UI-based test cases on the Vegas web platform. Jenkins supports as a dedicated automation CI tool, and tickets/pull requests would be maintained and completed through Jira and GitHub respectively.</p>
                  <p>Along with weekly syncs with QA and monthly backlog grooming sessions to denote new automation sessions, automation would complete regression cycles every 2 weeks to uphold the automated coverage and ensure that no bugs have been introduced into non-release components of Vegas.</p>
